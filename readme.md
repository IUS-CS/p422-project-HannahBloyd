# P422 Project (REPLACE ME)

Here, you should put your project proposal. It should be written in english text and describe what you intend to build along with any information necessary. Please use proper markdown formatting. You can find a guide here: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Your project should have the following requirements met:

* A server side component written with javascript that stores information in a database
* A client side component written in Angular
* At least four different interactive views for the client

# Project Proposal

My plan is to make a contact/phone book. It should be able to store a variety of contact information for people, like you would store in your phone.
Types of information that are currently planned to be store includes:
* Name
* Phone Number
* Address
* Email
* Company

The user will have the ability to:
* Create new contacts
* Retrieve all information from a given contact
* Edit a contact
* Delete a contact
* Create a group for similar contacts, which will include adding and deleting users from a group and getting all users and their information that are included in the group
* Searching your contacts based on certain fields
* Send a message to a contact and keep track of how many messages have been sent to that contact
